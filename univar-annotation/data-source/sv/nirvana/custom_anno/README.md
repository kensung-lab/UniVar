# Nirvana Custom Annotations

To generate [Nirvana custom annotations](https://illumina.github.io/NirvanaDocumentation/file-formats/custom-annotations), we first need to generate a tab-delimited file that is separated into two parts: the header & the data. Then we need to run Nirvana's **SAUtils** to convert it into Nirvana's native binary format. Output files having suffix **.nsi** and **.nsi.schema** should be uploaded to the annotation asset S3 bucket under folder **s3://{BUCKET}/sv-annot/{VERSION}/nirvana/custom_anno**.  
  
  
Not all of the custom annotations below can be generated by a simple bash script, especially for SV allele frequecy. Please refer the following links to find the detailed steps:
- [Clinvar](clinvar.sh)
- [Ensembl Gene/Exon](ensembl_gene.sh)
- [DGV Gold (Inner + Outer)](dgv_gold.sh)
- SV Allele Frequency
    - [1000G 30x (NYGC public data)](1kg_nygc_af.sh)
    - [1000G 30x (Ramesh's caller: Survindel + Insurveyor, joint-genotyped by Survtyper)](1kg_survtyper_af.sh)
